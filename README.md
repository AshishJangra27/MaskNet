# MaskNet
This project is about building a system which can detect whether a person is wearing mask or not on an image or live webcam video using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

I've used MobileNet for this purpose and then use transfer learning on it. The dataset used in this project is available on https://github.com/prajnasb/observations repository.
